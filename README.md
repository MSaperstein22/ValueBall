# ValueBall

I've been playing fantasy football since 2014. Each year, however, I would always become frustrated with the top analysts' preseason projections as they never seemed to be accurate by the end of the season. Their preseason projections would always closely mirror the final player rankings from the previous year, relying almost entirely on recency bias instead of statistical projections. In 2020, I decided to create a better way to project fantasy football performance using a spreadsheet to achieve the following goals:

1. Target players who are being undervalued ‚úÖ
   
3. Trade players who are being overvalued ‚õîÔ∏è

5. Finally beat my friends in fantasy football üòé

# Case Study - 2019 NFL Season

Matt Bowden is an ESPN staff writer. The following table compares his 2019 preseason wide reciever fantasy rankings to the 2019 final wide reciever fantasy rankings at the end of the season.

9 players who Bowden suggested would finish the season in the top 20 did not achieve that feat. Additionally, 3 other recievers who Bowden predicted would make the top 20 did so but they performed worse in the rankings than Bowden predicted. This shows how the analysts' preseason projections for wide recievers can be very inaccurate.

# Purpose
My attitude when playing fantasy football has always been if a wide reciever gets more targets, there is a greater chance that he will get more yards and touchdowns and score more points. Logically, this makes sense. The first step to recievers gaining yards and touchdowns is by getting receptions. And every new reception is a new chance to accumulate yards and score a touchdown.

In fantasy football, however, targets are not accounted for in the scoring. As a result, this statistic is often overlooked by even the most experienced fantasy football managers. **I needed to create a way to factor in targets along with all of the other typical stats to better value recievers based on their most recent performance.**

# Spreadsheet
In my original spreadsheet, I assigned each target a value of 0.74 points. I chose this value because it is more than the points given for one reciving yard (0.1 points), but less than the value for a reception in a PPR league (1 point). This is somewhat subjective, however, I chose to weigh the point value of each target to be closer to the point value of a reception than the point value of 1 recieving yard. This is because targets should be factored into our scoring in an influential way, but at the end of the day, a reception is more valuable than a target (in both PPR and non-PPR leagues) because it allows a player to gain points. This is true because recieving yards are accounted for in fantasy football scoring but targets are not.

By adding up the average points from targets, average points from yards, and average points from TDs per game, each player receives a new, original score. This score gives us a better view of how to value wide recievers because it takes into account a player's current number of targets. By my main mantra, this integrates the probability for a wide reciever scoring more points in the future into the new score. This spreadsheet could then highlight players who are currently recieving a ton of targets yet are not currently scoring the most yards or touchdowns in fantasy. These players are important to value highly because they are primed to score more yards and touchdowns in the future, yet might currently be undervalued.

I then ranked the recievers according to my scoring and compared that to the actual non-PPR fantasy scoring. The difference here is key: if the box is green and has a higher number, it means the player is being undervalued (he's recieving many targets but not yet scoring touchdowns) and you should buy him ASAP because there's a high chance he will score touchdowns in the future. If the box is red and has a higher number, it means the player is being overvalued (he's probably touchdown dependent and does not recieve many targets) and you should probably try to sell high because he's not being thrown the ball enough to have a high chance to score touchdowns in the future. By looking at this spreadsheet, I was able to sell some of my players high to other teams last year and trade for and add players who were being undervalued according to my analytics system.

The spreadsheet is automatically updated with the most recent data from the current NFL season. Access it using the following link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kpf9QdxtBV0tafUXUwOGLNR5V8OyPvUlc23D0oR21vI/edit?usp=sharing

Below are some screenshots of the spreadsheet after Week 3 of the 2023 NFL season.

## Python Script ##

In Summer 2023, I decided to write a Python script that could be used to calculate these scores and then graph the results. I utilized several technologies in this Python script:

1. Python: The entire script is written in Python, which is a high-level programming language.

2. Requests Library: I imported the requests library to make HTTP GET requests to the Fantasy Pros website and fetch its HTML content from the NFL wide reciever stats page. This is used to retrieve the most recent player data from the internet at any given moment to provide the user with the most up-to-date information.

3. Beautiful Soup (bs4): I imported the BeautifulSoup library from the bs4 package. BeautifulSoup is used for parsing HTML and XML documents. In this script, it is used to parse the HTML content of the webpage I fetched with requests and extract specific data from it.

4. Pandas Library: I imported the pandas library as pd. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. I use it to create and manipulate DataFrames, which are tabular data structures. In this script, I create a DataFrame to store and work with the extracted wide reciever data to eventually calculate new scores and rankings.

5. Matplotlib Library: I imported the matplotlib.pyplot library as plt. Matplotlib is a popular library for creating data visualizations in Python. I use it to generate a horizontal bar plot to visualize the rankings of wide recievers to buy low and sell high as well as the difference in my projected rankings and the actual rankings for fantasy football wide recievers.

Overall, this Python script combines web scraping (using Requests and BeautifulSoup), data manipulation (using Pandas), and data visualization (using Matplotlib) to analyze and visualize fantasy football wide reciever rankings to give fantasy football managers an advantage throughout the entire season.

The Python script can be found here: https://github.com/MSaperstein22/ValueBall/blob/main/ValueBall.py

Below is a screenshot of the graph of overvalued and undervalued wide reciviers based on data from the 2022 season.

# ValueBall Case Study - 2022 NFL Season

Looking at the graph from the end of the 2022 season, we can see that Chris Godwin was ValueBall's biggest buy low at the end of the season, with a difference of 8 rankings between ValueBall's ranking and his actual ranking. Godwin ended the season with 142 targets, 10th best in the league. However, Godwin only had 3 recieving touchdowns on the season. As a result, ValueBall highlighted Godwin as a player to buy low, with a high probabilitiy to score more points in the future based on his incredible average rate of 9.5 targets per game, 4th best in the league for wide recievers playing at least 14 games.

We also see that Garrett Wilson was the second biggest buy low at the end of the season. This makes sense as Wilson ended the season with 147 targets, tied for 6th best in the NFL, though he ended the season as the 21st best fantasy wide reciever. Wilson had an incredible season, though only totaling 4 touchdowns on the year. His 83 receptions and 1103 yards were enough to crown him NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. Based on his high target rates, Wilson is valued highly according to ValueBall.

Looking at ValueBall's well-valued players, we see wide recievers like Davante Adams, Stefon Diggs, and Justin Jefferson. Each of these 3 wide recievers finished the season in the top 5 of all fantasy wide recievers for total points. They also all finished in the top 4 in targets, in the top 5 in receiving yards, and in the top 8 in recieving touchdowns. From these stats, we can see why ValueBall indicated that these players were perfectly valued.

Looking at ValueBall's overvalued players, we see that Brandon Aiyuk was the most overvalued wide reciever. This makes sense as Aiyuk scored 8 receiving touchdowns, tied for 8th in the NFL, however, Aiyuk was 25th in the NFL in targets with 114 targets, averaging 6.7 targets per game. He also finished 21st in the NFL in reciving yards with 1015 yards. This shows that Aiyuk was very touchdown dependent, meaning his fantasy point totals depended heavily on touchdowns over consistent yardage. Some other overvalued players according to ValueBall included Christian Watson, AJ Brown, and Tyler Boyd, 3 recievers known for being touchdown dependent and overvalued in the fantasy world in 2022.

# Conclusion

Overall, ValueBall has helped me perform better in my fantasy football leagues every since I started using it in 2020. Over multiple years, I've acquired undervalued players highlighted on the spreadsheet that helped my team significantly later on in the season as they began scoring touchdowns and accumulating more fantasy points. Some players that I traded for courtesy of ValueBall's high undervalued scores include Keenan Allen, Travis Kelce, and Courtland Sutton.

ValueBall is changing the game of fantasy football, taking into account stats that few fantasy football managers consider when managing their teams during the season. In the future, I would like to furthur improve ValueBall by adding point values for target share and snap count percentage. This way, ValueBall can more accurately consider how often a reciver is having balls thrown to them by their QB as well as how often they are on the field relative to the rest of their offense. I would also want to extend this product to consider other position players including quarterbacks, running backs, and tight ends. Now and in the future, ValueBall has great potential to help fantasy football managers better value players and win their leagues.
